It is calculated by subtracting the COGS from revenue and dividing the result by revenue.\n\nA higher gross margin indicates that a company is generating more revenue from its core business activities and is able to maintain a healthy profit margin. A lower gross margin may indicate that a company is facing increased competition or higher costs of production, which are impacting its ability to generate profits.\n\nIt is important to note that gross margin can vary widely depending on the industry and the specific business model of a company.
